# Leaflet_Challenge

The purpose of this project was to analyze earthquake data globally using Leaflet within JavaScript. 

Created a map using Leaflet that plots all earthquakes from a gathered data set based on longitude and latitude.

The data markers resemble the magnitude by the size of the marker and the depth by the color of the marker. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should darker.

The data markers include popups that provide additional information about that particular earthquake upon clicking on it. At the bottom right of the map, there is a also a legend that further clarifies the data.
